# My First Website Project 🌐

Welcome to my first website project! 🎉 This is my initial attempt at building and designing a website as I explore and learn web development. The project serves as both a learning experience and a showcase of my growing skills.

### Features:
- **Purpose**: A simple and responsive website layout created from scratch.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Website**: [Visit the website](https://akademitip.com) 

### Reflections:
After reviewing the project, I’ve noticed many mistakes and areas for improvement. These include optimizing the layout, enhancing responsiveness, and improving the structure of the code. While it’s not perfect, I’m proud of this as a stepping stone in my web development journey.

### Why This Project?
As a beginner, I wanted to dive into web development, experiment with layouts, styles, and media queries, and learn how to make websites functional and visually appealing. This repository reflects my progress and the things I've learned along the way.

### Thoughts of my future self:
Bro this sucks who coded this ew
